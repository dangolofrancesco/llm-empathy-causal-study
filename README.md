# llm-empathy-causal-study
With this project we aim to determine if a more empathetic chatbot response causally increases a userâ€™s immediate emotional attachment.

# Research Project Causal Model

This diagram outlines the causal relationships, confounders, moderators, and mediators in our study.

## Causal Model (DAG)

This diagram outlines the potential causal relationships in the study, including confounders, moderators, and mediators.
